React Native Boilerplate - react-native-redux-drawer-thunk-boilerplate
===========================================

React Native Boilerplate is a starting point for React Native application. This project is configured with redux, redux thunk 
and redux persist. Latest version of react-navigation (v4.0.10).

## I have intentionally left android and iOS folder, not pushing to git a repo because it's size is too big so just use the android and iOS folder generated by your new project and use these files to start the boiler plate to replace other files in new project 


## Features

* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
* [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) 
* [React Native Gesture Handler](https://github.com/kmagiera/react-native-gesture-handler) 
* [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)

## Prerequisites

* [Node](https://nodejs.org) v10 (it is recommended to install it via [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A development machine set up for React Native by following [these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/

* To use this route to start a react native project
* Install  NODE

* Install NPM

* Install  NPX

* NPM is installed global NPX


* Then give command and NPX

* NPX space react native init your project name

* Then carefully replace files from this report with your project and after that give command and NPX react native start to start Metro for NPX react native run-android to start the project in android simulator

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/kumarnavinrai/react-native-redux-drawer-thunk-boilerplate` <your project name>`
2. Go to project's root directory, `cd <your project name>`
3. Remove `.git` folder,  `rm -rf .git`
4. Open `package.json` and change the `name` property with your project name
5. Open `app.json` and replace `'RNApp'` by your project name 

6. Run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install dependencies

7. Latest versions of react-navigation uses gesture handler which is native module. For android you have to do some additional steps to configure them. Follow [these instructions](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/en/getting-started.html)
#### React Navigation should work fine even without these but when u need gestures or drawer navigation you need this setup

    
8. Enjoy!!!
